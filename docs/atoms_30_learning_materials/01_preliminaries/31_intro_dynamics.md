## Linear Momentum Principle {#sets status=draft}
\begin{definition}[Linear Momentum]\label{def:Linear_Momentum} The **linear momentum** of a particle is defined as $\vec{P} = m\vec{v}$
\end{definition}

### Principle

**The principle of linear momentum** for a single particle:

$\dot{\vec{P}} = m\vec{a} = \vec{F}$, where:

$\vec{P}$ ... linear momentum of the particle

$m$ ... mass of the particle

$\vec{a}$ ... acceleration of the particle

$\vec{F}$ ... resultant force acting on the particle

**Conservation of linear momentum:** When $\vec{F} = 0$, we obtain $\vec{P} = *const*$. Therefore, linear momentum is conserved under vanishing force.

## Angular Momentum Momentum Principle {#sets status=draft}

\begin{definition}[Angular Momentum]\label{def:Angular_momentum} The **angular momentum** $H_B(t)$ of the particle **m** w.r.t a point **B** is defined
as the cross product of the vector $\vec{v}_B$
between the point **B** and the particle with the
linear momentum $\vec{P}$,

$H_B(t) := $\vec{v}_B(t) Ã— \vec{P}(t)$.

Here, B can be an arbitrary point in space, either fixed or moving.
\end{definition}

### Principle

**The principle of angular momentum** for a simgle particle:

## Forces
THe resultant force on a system of particles can be split into external and internal forces.

$\vec{F} = \vec{F}_{ext} + \vec{F}_{int}$. 

\begin{definition}[External Force]\label{def:External_force} An _external force_ $\vec{F}_{ext}$ is a force whose reaction force does not act on any particle _j_ of the system, _i_, _j_ = 1,2,..._n_.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Internal Force]\label{def:Internal_force} An _internal force_ $\vec{F}_{int}$ is a force whose reaction force acts on some particle _j_ of the system, _i_, _j_ = 1,2,..._n_.
\end{definition}

- The sum of all internal forces on a system of particles is **zero**.
- Continuing from above, Total resultant force $\vec{F}$ acting on a system of particles, is equal to total external force.



## Constraints

The motion of a particle is often limited by effects external to the particle. For example, the particle may only allowed to move in a certain direction or must stay on the ground (2D-motion). Such a limitation on the motion is called a _constraint_.

\begin{definition}[Constraint]\label{def:Constraint} A _constraint_ is a scalar relation that limits the possible displacements of particles, i.e. , prohibits the particle from moving arbitrarily in space.
\end{definition}

Different examples of constraints:
- Rigid Link
- Rotating tube
- Planar motion
- Planar rolling

Basic types of constraints:
- Holonomic contraints
- Non-holonomic constraints

### Holonomic and non-holonomic constraints
\begin{definition}[Holonomic constraints]\label{def:Holonomic_constraint} A _holonomic constraint_ is a constraint that only depends on the current position of the particles involved and the current time. A _non-holonomic constraint_ also depends on time derivatives of the motion.

## Degrees of Freedom

\begin{definition}[degree of freedom]\label{def:DOF} The _degree of freedom_ (DOF) of a system is defined as the number of independent generalized coordinates necessary to describe the motion of the system completely and uniquely. The DOF of a hil
